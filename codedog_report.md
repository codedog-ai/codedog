### Change Details

| Major Changes | Description |
|---|---|
| **[base.py](https://github.com/kratos06/codedog/pull/4/files#diff-e17d0c4db918f1b7136ae05ffe81fa44a88c2b82 "codedog/chains/pr_summary/base.py")** | This diff adds docstring to the `_chain_type` property in the `PRSummaryChain` class, providing information about the method and its return value. |
| **[langchain_utils.py](https://github.com/kratos06/codedog/pull/4/files#diff-375d9d7fa520083e33879808661c8004ce64c46e "codedog/utils/langchain_utils.py")** | This diff contains a change in the `load_gpt4_llm` function. The function description was updated to provide details on how a GPT-4 model is loaded based on the environment configuration. The function now includes information on initializing either an AzureChatOpenAI instance or a ChatOpenAI instance depending on the 'AZURE_OPENAI' variable. The updated description clarifies that the function does not verify if the provided API key has access to GPT-4. |
| **[test_pr_summary_chain.py](https://github.com/kratos06/codedog/pull/4/files#diff-e9ca37901d331469fa7dfd3cb2e5fbfe46832cee "tests/unit/chains/test_pr_summary_chain.py")** | This diff contains:	- Add setup test fixtures for PRSummaryChain tests	- Add parser functions that parse input text to produce a default pull request summary	- Add a method to return the format instructions	- Add a test for the _call method of PRSummaryChain. |
| **[test_pull_request_processor.py](https://github.com/kratos06/codedog/pull/4/files#diff-778a44bf5ae1434119d6890ab3e15b417e6e37d0 "tests/unit/processors/test_pull_request_processor.py")** | This diff includes the addition of a test case for the function `test_build_change_summaries` which verifies the conversion of inputs and outputs to ChangeSummary objects. |
| **[test_github_retriever.py](https://github.com/kratos06/codedog/pull/4/files#diff-0e6c54eb717e85e7221e55320233bb2370755f19 "tests/unit/retrievers/test_github_retriever.py")** | This diff contains the addition of docstrings for the `setUp` and `test_empty_pr` functions in the `TestGithubRetriever` class to provide explanations for the purpose of these functions. |
| **[test_langchain_utils.py](https://github.com/kratos06/codedog/pull/4/files#diff-b12e6515f25543564c14f0b11aacb8fd63b847ad "tests/unit/utils/test_langchain_utils.py")** | This diff includes changes in the test cases of the `TestLangchainUtils` class in the file `test_langchain_utils.py`. Specifically, it modifies the docstrings of the test methods `test_module_imports` and `test_load_gpt_llm_functions` to provide more descriptive explanations of what the tests are verifying. The changes highlight the purpose of the tests and what API functions are being tested. |


| Changes | Description |
|---|---|
| **[conftest.py](https://github.com/kratos06/codedog/pull/4/files#diff-28d23778df164522b1656c1631d1e87d1c2527ab "tests/conftest.py")** | This diff contains changes in the test fixture functions `mock_pull_request` and `mock_llm`. The comments in both functions have been updated with more detailed descriptions of what each fixture does. The `mock_pull_request` function now includes additional information about the attributes of the mock `PullRequest` object created, and the `mock_llm` function now specifies that it creates a mock language model for unit testing, with a stubbed `invoke` method that always returns a dictionary containing a test response. |
| **[test_end_to_end.py](https://github.com/kratos06/codedog/pull/4/files#diff-49db3a8c98cc637fd16afe82fc373d1c33a16efd "tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py")** | This diff contains the addition of a test case for the GitHub pull request flow in the `TestEndToEndFlow` class in `test_end_to_end.py`. The test simulates the end-to-end process of handling a GitHub pull request by creating mock repository and pull request objects, configuring mocked language models, and patching the summary and review chain factories. It verifies the correct summarization and review of the pull request, as well as the compilation of the report by the reporter. Additionally, it asserts that the chain factories and their chain calls are invoked exactly once. |
