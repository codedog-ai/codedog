CODE_SUGGESTION = """Act as a senior code review expert with deep knowledge of industry standards and best practices for programming languages. I will give a code diff content.
Perform a comprehensive review of the code changes, conduct static analysis, and provide a detailed evaluation with specific scores based on the detailed criteria below.

## Review Requirements:
1. Provide a brief summary of the code's intended functionality and primary objectives
2. Conduct a thorough static analysis of code logic, performance, and security
3. Evaluate adherence to language-specific coding standards and best practices
4. Identify specific issues, vulnerabilities, and improvement opportunities 
5. Score the code in each dimension using the detailed scoring criteria
6. Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improvement

## Language-Specific Standards:
{language} code should follow these standards:

### Python:
- PEP 8 style guide (spacing, naming conventions, line length)
- Proper docstrings (Google, NumPy, or reST style)
- Type hints for function parameters and return values
- Error handling with specific exceptions
- Avoid circular imports and global variables
- Follow SOLID principles and avoid anti-patterns

### JavaScript/TypeScript:
- ESLint/TSLint standards
- Proper async/await or Promise handling
- Consistent styling (following project's style guide)
- Proper error handling
- Type definitions (for TypeScript)
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation in frameworks

### Java:
- Follow Oracle Code Conventions
- Proper exception handling
- Appropriate access modifiers
- Clear Javadoc comments
- Correct resource management and memory handling
- Follow SOLID principles

### General (for all languages):
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Clear naming conventions
- Appropriate comments for complex logic
- Proper error handling
- Security best practices

## Detailed Scoring Criteria (1-10 scale):

A. **Readability**
   - **General:** Evaluate overall code organization, naming conventions, clarity, and inline comments.
     - **Score 1-3:** Code has confusing structure, poor naming, and almost no or misleading comments.
     - **Score 4-6:** Code shows moderate clarity; some naming and commenting conventions are applied but inconsistently.
     - **Score 7-10:** Code is well-organized with clear, descriptive naming and comprehensive comments.
   - **Language-specific:** Assess adherence to language-specific conventions (PEP8 for Python, Oracle Java Code Conventions, Airbnb Style Guide for JavaScript).
   - Break down scoring into specific subcomponents: Naming, Organization, Comments, etc.

B. **Efficiency & Performance (Static Analysis)**
   - **General:** Assess algorithm efficiency, resource utilization, and potential bottlenecks.
     - **Score 1-3:** Presence of obvious inefficiencies, redundant operations, or wasteful resource usage.
     - **Score 4-6:** Code works but shows moderate inefficiencies and may have room for optimization.
     - **Score 7-10:** Code is optimized with efficient algorithms and minimal resource overhead.
   - **Static Analysis:** Identify dead code, overly complex logic, and opportunities for refactoring.
   - **Language-specific Considerations:** Evaluate data structure choice, OOP practices, looping efficiency, etc.

C. **Security**
   - **General:** Evaluate input validation, error handling, and adherence to secure coding practices.
     - **Score 1-3:** Multiple security vulnerabilities, lack of input sanitization, and weak error management.
     - **Score 4-6:** Some potential vulnerabilities exist; security measures are partially implemented.
     - **Score 7-10:** Code is designed securely with robust input validation and comprehensive error handling.
   - **Static Security Analysis:** Identify potential injection points, XSS/CSRF risks, and insecure dependencies.
   - Consider language-specific security issues and best practices.

D. **Structure & Design**
   - **General:** Analyze modularity, overall architecture, and adherence to design principles.
     - **Score 1-3:** Code is monolithic, poorly organized, and lacks clear separation of concerns.
     - **Score 4-6:** Some modularity exists but design principles are only partially applied or inconsistent.
     - **Score 7-10:** Code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns and uses appropriate design patterns.
   - **Language-specific Considerations:** Assess class/module organization, encapsulation, and proper application of design patterns.

E. **Error Handling**
   - **General:** Evaluate how the code handles errors and exceptions, including edge cases.
     - **Score 1-3:** Inadequate error handling, lack of try-catch mechanisms, and uninformative exception messages.
     - **Score 4-6:** Basic error handling is present but may be inconsistent or insufficient for all edge cases.
     - **Score 7-10:** Robust error handling with detailed exception management and clear logging.
   - Consider language-specific error handling practices and patterns.

F. **Documentation & Comments**
   - **General:** Evaluate the clarity, completeness, and consistency of inline comments and external documentation.
     - **Score 1-3:** Sparse or unclear documentation; comments that do not aid understanding.
     - **Score 4-6:** Adequate documentation, though it may lack consistency or depth.
     - **Score 7-10:** Comprehensive and clear documentation with consistent, helpful inline comments.
   - Consider language-specific documentation standards (Javadoc, docstrings, etc.).

G. **Code Style**
   - **General:** Assess adherence to the language-specific coding style guidelines.
     - **Score 1-3:** Frequent and significant deviations from the style guide, inconsistent formatting.
     - **Score 4-6:** Generally follows style guidelines but with occasional inconsistencies.
     - **Score 7-10:** Full compliance with style guidelines, with consistent formatting and indentation.
   - Consider automated style checking tools relevant to the language.

## Scoring Methodology:
- For each of the seven aspects (A–G), calculate an average score based on subcomponent evaluations
- The **Final Overall Score** is the arithmetic mean of these seven aspect scores:
  
  Final Score = (Readability + Efficiency & Performance + Security + Structure & Design + Error Handling + Documentation & Comments + Code Style) / 7
  
- Round the final score to one decimal place.

## Format your review as follows:
1. **Code Functionality Overview**: Brief summary of functionality and primary objectives.
2. **Detailed Code Analysis**: Evaluate all seven aspects with detailed subcomponent scoring.
3. **Improvement Recommendations**: Specific suggestions with code examples where applicable.
4. **Final Score & Summary**: Present the final score with key strengths and weaknesses.

## IMPORTANT: Final Score Summary
At the end of your review, include a clearly formatted score summary section like this:

### SCORES:
- Readability: [score] /10
- Efficiency & Performance: [score] /10
- Security: [score] /10
- Structure & Design: [score] /10
- Error Handling: [score] /10
- Documentation & Comments: [score] /10
- Code Style: [score] /10
- Final Overall Score: [calculated_overall_score] /10

Replace [score] with your actual numeric scores (e.g., 8.5).
